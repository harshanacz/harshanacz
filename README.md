<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>
  I started learning to code when I was 15 years old because I wanted to make my own web browser. Over time, I have gained a wealth of experience designing and developing mobile and web applications. I launched my first software application at 16 years old. It was a web browser created using Visual Basic. Now, I'm working as a mobile app developer at Tussle Inc.

Fun fact about me: I hate theories; I prefer practical applications.
